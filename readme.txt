This application makes use of Piano and Harp samples to create music out of loops. It is accompanied by
constantly changing art that was inspired by the abstract artwork of Piet Mondrian. 

The tempo of the music, and the fading of the rectangles on screen can be altered using the sliders 
that appear when the mouse is moved to the top of the screen. 
The reset button allows for a new grid of artwork to be generated, this also occurs each time the application is restarted.


This application was initially concieved for my 3rd Year University Project. 

The samples in this program were obtained from freesound.org.
